# And the second line...

### This should be the third line *I think when you want to make text on a new line you need to hit enter/return twice*

When the green bars- at least green on my vscode- appear to the right of the line numbers you know you've done it right.  Make sure to add a space after the hashtags to use the markdown for a heading.

### return no 3 from me! Getting the hang of it now. I think the git status file is a  "README file" due to we havnt created one ourselves... Back to you!
